# Emoji Reference for Documentation

I've replaced all the problematic ?? characters with proper emojis that should display correctly:

- ?? for headers and quick start
- ?? for prerequisites
- ? for quick start
- ?? for API/web
- ? for health check
- ??? for tools (pgAdmin)
- ?? for PostgreSQL
- ?? for Redis
- ?? for development commands
- ?? for overview
- ??? for database
- ?? for testing
- ?? for monitoring
- ?? for environment variables
- ?? for security
- ?? for troubleshooting
- ?? for resources
- ?? for development workflow
- ?? for the closing

These emojis are widely supported and should display correctly across different platforms and editors.
